# Get APIs
# This action is responsible for getting the APIs from the entity's metadata.json file
# It is called by the main build-deploy workflow and runs in parallel for each API defined in the entity's metadata.json file

# Key responsibilities:
# 1. Parses the metadata.json file to extract API configurations
# 2. Filters APIs based on environment-specific settings
# 3. Outputs a list of enabled APIs

# Workflow inputs:
# - entity: The entity (e.g., tripwhiz, roameasy) to get APIs for
# - environment: Target environment (development, acceptance, production)
# - entity_metadata: Path to the entity's metadata.json file

# Main outputs:
# - Generates a list of APIs to be deployed for the given entity and environment
